# video-log-overlay

This small project is a personal video log overlay generator designed to add dynamic overlay to video
logs. The goal of the tool is to automatically generate an overlay that includes basic information about
video and user-realted info, such as:

- LOCATION
- DATE
- TIME
- WEATHER
- LOG NUMBER

The overlay will be updated dynamically as its recorded and video logs are stored. Its programmed to pull
real-time data like weather as an example, eliminating need for manual input.
